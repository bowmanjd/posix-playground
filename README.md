# POSIX playground

Files for building a container image with the following shells and tools:

- [posh: Policy-compliant Ordinary SHell](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/posh/posh.1.en.html), a strict POSIX-compliant shell
- [dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/), a POSIX-compliant shell directly descended from [ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell)
- [rlwrap](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) to offer readline support for either of the above shells, for convenience
- [checkbashisms](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/devscripts/checkbashisms.1.en.html) finds "[bashisms](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism)" in shell scripts
- [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/), a versatile shell script analysis tool

An article I wrote on the subject [is available at bowmanjd.com](https://www.bowmanjd.com/).
